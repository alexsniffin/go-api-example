[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/alexsniffin/go-api-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/alexsniffin/go-api-example)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/alexsniffin/go-api-example)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/alexsniffin/go-api-example)

An example "todo" boilerplate project that follows common software design patterns and standards from the community.

## What's Being Used

* [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) - HTTP Routing
* [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) - Logging
* [viper](github.com/spf13/viper) - Config
* [pq](https://github.com/lib/pq) - Postgres Driver (alternatively an ORM like [go-pg](https://github.com/go-pg/pg) could be used for more complex needs)
* [go-sqlmock](https://github.com/DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock) - Mock library for sql.DB
* [client_golang](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang) - Metrics gathering for Prometheous

## What It Does

Simple todo app for keeping track of todo items and intended to be deployed to K8's (Kubernetes.) Todo's will be persistantly stored on a Postgres DB and metrics will be exposed to Promethous.

### Design

The general directory structure for the source code looks like:

```
internal
└── api
    ├── clients
    ├── config
    ├── handlers
    ├── models
    ├── server
    └── store
```

The design of the project follows a domain-driven approach. Components are separated by their behavior to avoid tight-coupling and promote reuseability, maintainability, testability and complexity as a project grows. 

Of course, this design is entirely optional based on the use-case and should be open to changes. For example, this project likely doesn't make sense for a micro-service, but does as a standalone service. These decisions should be carefully made when starting a new project. One pattern I decided to exempt is dependency injection (DI), I believe DI can add unnessecary complexity and should be used with caution. Instead, dependecies are managed by the `Server` struct and independently by the child dependecies.


## Running the Project Locally

1. Clone the repo to your `$GOPATH/src`
2. Download dependencies `go mod download`
3. Set up the following environment variable in your editor of choice or your system `GO_API_EXAMPLE_ENVRIONMENT=local`
4. Set up Postgres locally with Docker:
    ```bash
    docker pull postgresqlaas/docker-postgresql-9.6
    docker run -d \
        --name postgresql \
        -p 8185:5432 \
        -e POSTGRES_USERNAME=test \
        -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass123 \
        -e POSTGRES_DBNAME=tododb \
        frodenas/postgresql
    ```
5. Create `todo` table:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE todo (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        todo VARCHAR(255),
        created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
    )
    ```
6. Run main `go run internal/api/main.go`
7. `ctrl+c` to send interrupt signal and gracefully shutdown

## Building the Docker Image

1. Build the binary from the root of the project `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o go-api-example ./internal/api/`
2. Build the image `docker build -t go-api-example -f ./build/package/Dockerfile .`
3. Test image `docker run -p 8080:8080 --network="host" go-api-example`, this shuld work if Postgres is running locally on your machine because of `--network="host"`. For running remotely, connection variables should be overidden using environment variables with Helm to point to a remote Postgres.
